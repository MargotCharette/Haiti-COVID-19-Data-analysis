# Haiti-COVID-19-Data-analysis

Preliminary analysis COVID-19 data for Haiti using R

This project includes data cleaning instructions, as well as plot and tables creation using COVID-19 linelist data from Haiti.

This R project includes: a script provided as a R markdown document as well as a data folder containing the data used for the analysis.

Please make sure to *first* open the Haiti_epi.R project file and make sure you are working within the R project since file paths are defined from this root directory. You can open the R markdown document containing the code we will be looking at after you have opened the R project.
